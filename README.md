# Image Processing Project 

## Overview
This project focuses on image processing, implementing fundamental operations in C++. The code includes features such as loading PPM image files and applying filters with different colors to them, providing a solid foundation for image manipulation with just code.

## Development Environment
The code is structured as a Visual Studio Solution for Windows 10. Please note that it was developed on an older version of Visual Studio some years ago. Due to potential compatibility issues with newer versions, it may not run seamlessly. However, the code itself is valuable for studying C++ and image processing techniques.

## Files
- **Main.cpp:** The main program demonstrating image processing functionalities.
- **Image.h and Image.cpp:** Classes for image representation and manipulation.
- **Filter.h and Filter.cpp:** Base class for filters and specific filter implementations.
- **Array2D.h:** Template class for a 2D array.
- **Vec3.h:** Template class representing a 3D vector.

## How to Use
1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the executable to observe the image processing effects.
4. If it fails, just open the files in Visual Studio Code and go through them, while reading the comments.
